# Week-2-Challenge

## Purpose:

We are helping Steve analyze stocks to offer his parents well-analyzed options in the stocks they should invest in relating to green energy, as well as reduce the time it takes for the code to run. The code analyzes the stocks of two different years, it oversights the volume and the percent return, as well as provides visual representations of how the stocks perform.
